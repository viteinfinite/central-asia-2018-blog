We wake up quite early, at 7 AM Beijing time, to check out from the hotel and take the taxi that will lead us to the beginning of our journey across the Chinese-Kyrgyz border. We booked the taxi through an agent that Simone met at the hotel when we arrived in Kashgar. The guy asked us 1000 yuan (something like 80 euros) for a 1h30 trip until Urumqat, the customs before the border. We could have paid much less, but as we are on a planified trip and we can't afford to lose time (for example, hitchiking, or waiting for a bus that never comes, things like that) we preferred paying more to be sure that we would cross the border without delays.

Well, at some point of the route, half an hour before the customs, the driver, who once again doesn't speak a single word in English, stops the car and tells us to get inside another car, where two other men are waiting for us. We message our agent to ask him if it's normal: it's not. We'd really like avoiding jumping on a car we don't know without being able to speak to anyone, but the driver begins putting all our stuff (just to remind: two big backpacks, one trolley, two small backpacks!) inside the other car. We ask our agent to call the driver, which he promptly does. Our driver seems upset, but agrees to get us again in his car, without further talking. When we arrive at the police station for the first control, the police takes our passports, tells us to get all our stuff and our driver waits for us on the other side, after the control. There, we meet a group of five Italians and another group of two composed by an Italian guy, named Simone, and a Hong Kongese girl, named Wei. The control takes about 20 minutes, then we get inside the car again and continue for about five or ten minutes until arriving at the customs. This is the point where the driver leaves us and gets paid. 

Before entering the customs building, we pass two controls, where they check our passports and write down information about us (name, passport number, phone number) on a notebook. We realize they write the first name at the place of the last name, and they don't look like they really understand what they're doing. 

After these two controls, we get a lift from the vehicle of the Italian guys, who rented a bus for this journey, for another couple of minutes, until the proper customs control. There, the police retire our passports and keep them for 15 minutes. The atmosphere is relaxed and police officers are cold but not disrespectful.

We then pass other two passport checks and, distant not more than 5 or 10 meters from each other, and we get our luggage summarily controlled. 

Funny enough, during the whole procedure, another police officer with a reflex camera photographs us as a paparazzo. Another officer then helps us with the luggages while the photograph keep on shooting photos to testimony the kindness of the border control police.

We are supposed to take a taxi to the border with Simone and Wei and, while we wait for them, one of the Chinese agents ask us to pose for a propaganda photo. The situation gets funnier and funnier - and even policemen look amused. After being photographed multiple times, we ask the officers if we can make a selfie with them: the youngest one among the officers asks his boss who harshly replies "No photo! No photo!". Prisca is really pissed off with this! Even the young policeman looks naively disappointed, and excuses himself multiple times.

When Simone and Wei finally get to the other side too, the boss wants us again to be taken in picture for their internal instruction material, which we refuse in order to be able to get to the final part of the border as soon as possible.

After almost two more hours by car with a driver provided by the police, we finally arrive at the Chinese side of the border with Kyrgystan. There are only a few trucks waiting and the group of Italians. Guess what?

The border is closed!! The opening times are from 10:30 AM to 1:30 PM and from 4 pm to 7 PM, which is expected. Too bad we arrive at almost 2 PM, so we have to wait for two hours before it opens again. While waiting we have the opportunity to discuss with the other people of the groups and buy something to eat at the shop - definitely the most weird shop for a border, but useful anyway! The border reopens with some delay, so we get in the car to pass again two controls: first with a funny officer, who even gets in the car with us and lets us take a picture of him with us, and a second one with a cold guy who doesn't seem to know how to smile. We finally get to the Kyrgyz side, safe and sound, relieved that we all made it. 

Here begins the second part of our journey, from the Kyrgyz side of the border, to Osh. But this, it's another story.
